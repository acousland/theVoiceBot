# About

The Voice Bot leverages AI to enhance public understanding of the Voice Referendum and related topics. It provides a platform for users to engage in informed discussions, helping simplify complex subjects through interactive dialogues.

# Installation

This project requires Python 3.6+ and Streamlit.

You can install the project and its dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Privacy

No data is stored or recorded. All code is publicly available on GitHub for transparency. The OpenAI API may retain data for up to 30 days for abuse prevention but does not use it for model training. For more details, see OpenAIâ€™s privacy policy.

# Training Sources

The bot is informed by the official Australian Electoral Commission's yes | no referendum pamphlet, summarized to discuss core issues while striving for impartiality.

# Architecture

Built with Python and LangChain, The Voice Bot employs Streamlit for its user interface and utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for language processing. The entire codebase is available on GitHub.

# Limitations and Ethical Issues
 
**Accuracy of Information:** The bot may occasionally generate inaccurate information. Users should verify facts with multiple authoritative sources.

**Limited Scope:** The bot is based on a specific dataset and may not reflect the most recent developments.

**Complexity and Insensitivity:** The bot may not capture all nuances of sensitive social values due to the complexity of the issues and limitations of the training data.

**Balance Fallacy:** The bot might give equal weight to unequal arguments, leading to potentially skewed discussions.

**Compromising Human Autonomy:** Heavy reliance on the bot for information might diminish personal agency and critical thinking.
